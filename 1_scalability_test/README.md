Different problems are given to the robot increasing in complexity.

1. check that always the planner produces the same output for a
given domain + problem definition (with same parameters)

2. check quality of the plan and if it is able to solve the problem
in the specified time

3. is using distance matrix to pick objects

4. check if it really goes to the cheap platforms and leaves
the expensive ones at the end

5. compare the different search parameters and comment on the findings

use run_experiment_1.sh
configure inside the number of problems to solve
configure inside experiment_1.sh timeout and other parameters
